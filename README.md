Simple FTP Client and Server Program built using Python 2.7. The user interface was built using Tkinter.

Instructions for use:
1) Change the file paths in the file testserver.py to where you want to read files from
2) Start the server (>python testserver.py) and the client(>python testclient.py) and use the program. Keep a note of the ports being used by the server and clients. They should be the same for both programs
